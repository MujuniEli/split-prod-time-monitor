# split-prod-time-tracker

I built this site to help me stay focused and also tracker my productive time.

## How to use

I will use myself as an example..., So I work 8 hours a day and then I split each hour into six(6) 10 minute segments.

- In the Rows input I add 8 to create 8 rows
- In the columns input I add 6 to create 6 columns
- So for every 10 minute segment I stay on task I click that segment's button once turning it to green with a &#10004; symbol.
- For a segment where am unable to stay on task I double click to turn that segment's button red with a &#88; symbol.
